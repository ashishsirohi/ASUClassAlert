# ASUClassAlert

Arizona State University is huge, home to approximately 80K students from around the world. And it offers a large variety of courses across different domains to accommodate all the students but sometimes, few courses are red hot, maybe because of the professor or maybe it's their last chance to get the course as they are graduating or it's a degree requirement course etc. but it's not possible to accommodate all. So the only hope of getting the course is if somebody changes his/her mind and drops it. But ASU doesn't have any system which can notify students if a course has been dropped or something similar. 

In order to grab that open course, you have to be on the course site all the time and check it continuously. Lots of waste of time, right? and even after that, there is no guarantee that will get that course. I myself faced the issue and that's how I came up with the idea of writing a script which will track the status of the specified course and notify me once it is available. I wrote it, it worked and I got the course. But then I thought, why not help other students as everyone is not from Computer Science background or write code. So I turned my script into a fully functional [web application](http://asuca.herokuapp.com) where users can sign up/login in and register for the courses they want to get notified for.
